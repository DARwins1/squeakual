		"Well, Delta's MIA.",
		"I talked with one of Clayde's guys who went to check on them.",
		"They stopped responding after their little encounter with Bravo at one of those uplink stations.",
		"And, they've abandoned all of the uplinks that they were assigned to capture.",
		"There weren't any signs of a struggle, the Collective wasn't even there.",
		"But the insides of the uplinks were trashed.",
		"Delta wasn't driven away. They turned tail and sabotaged those uplinks.",
		"",
		"So... that makes it treason for them, too.",
		"I always thought that they were on the level.",
		"But, I guess none of that matters anymore.",
		"",
		"Clayde's probably fuming about it, but he's still dead focused on apprehending the Lieutenant and his cohorts.",
		"Which is why Foxtrot and I are getting ready to take out Team Bravo right now.",
		"We're not letting these guys slip away a second time.",
		"Bravo is holed up right in the contaminated heart of the city.",
		"Not where I would've gone, but I guess the Lieutenant doesn't have many options anymore.",
		"",
		"I guess that after the Lieutenant's rabble is dealt with, we're coming for Delta next.",
		"A shame.",
		"Now that I think about it, Foxtrot and I are the only Commanders still loyal to the Supreme General.",
		"I guess that means Clayde was right, not putting his trust in us.",
		"What a treacherous lot we've turned out to be.",
		"",
		"Well, I'M still loyal to the cause!",
		"And I know Foxtrot will follow us to the end, too.",
		"Even if we have to cut all those traitors down.",
		"I'll show Clayde that he can at least trust ME.",
		"I'll PROVE it."
