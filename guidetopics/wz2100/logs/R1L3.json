		"I've been doing some spyin' on big Brak's boys, it's what I do best, after all.",
		"I even got my own little radio set up, so I can listen in on whatever the man himself has been shouting about.",
		"",
		"Boy, I've NEVER seen him this mad!",
		"Some new guys just dropped in outta nowhere, started blowin' stuff up, and Brak is PISSED.",
		"He's been yellin' and hollerin' into that radio all day!",
		"",
		"Sounds like he wants his boys to raid those newcomers pretty soon.",
		"He's bringing out all the big guns, buses, rockets, those damn choppers.",
		"Now, if these newcomers were some run of the mill gang, they'd be dead meat.",
		"These guys, however, are definitely no ordinary gang.",
		"",
		"I got curious myself, so I went to go peek at our new \"guests\".",
		"And... wow.",
		"Those guys mean some SERIOUS business.",
		"They're seriously tech'ed out. They've got tanks, guard towers, flying transports, and these soldiers wearing giant suits of metal armor.",
		"I've never seen anything like em' since...",
		"Well... since before.",
		"",
		"If you ask me, Brak's got no chance against those guys.",
		"If I were him, I'd be staying far away from them.",
		"But, if the radio's anything to go by, he'll be trying his luck within the hour.",
		"",
		"Whatever. His funeral I guess.",
		"It'll be fun to watch from a distance."
