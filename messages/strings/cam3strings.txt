/* Mission Briefing */
L1_BMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Greetings Commander.")
L1_BMSG2		_("I am Edmund Clayde, current head General of the North American Reclamation Syndicate.")
L1_BMSG3		_("I'll act as the overseer of this operation.")
L1_BMSG4		_("You have been assigned to lead team Alpha to accomplish our goals.")
L1_BMSG5		_("Your first task is to establish a base of operations.")
L1_BMSG6		_("Recovered documents evidence the existence of a Pre-Collapse NASDA site located south of your position.")
L1_BMSG7		_("We believe this site likely houses nuclear weapons.")
L1_BMSG8		_("Therefore, securing it is our first priority.")
L1_BMSG9		_("Take your forces, and travel overland towards this site.")
L1_BMSG10		_("You may need to use your weapons to clear a path through the trees.")
/* Scavenger Message */
L1_SCAVMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: I've had my technicians run a quick analysis on the site you have found.")
L1_SCAVMSG2		_("After a preliminary scan, we can confirm that these silos indeed contain nuclear warheads.")
L1_SCAVMSG3		_("However, your mission is not over yet, Commander.")
L1_SCAVMSG4		_("We've detected numerous radio transmissions from scavengers around the NASDA site.")
L1_SCAVMSG5		_("If their radio chatter is anything to go by, then they're too busy fighting each other to notice us yet.")
L1_SCAVMSG6		_("Commander Alpha, I'm ordering you to clear them out in order to ensure the safety of this site.")
L1_SCAVMSG7		_("Take some time to establish your forces, then move out and neutralize any nearby outposts.")
L1_SCAVMSG8		_("Regardless of how you feel about diplomacy, this site is too important to negotiate over with the local gangs.")

/* L2S Hostages (Setup)*/
/* Mission Briefing */
L2_BMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Congratulations on securing our new base, Commander.")
L2_BMSG2		_("The Council has reviewed the report of your success and are pleased with your results.")
L2_BMSG3		_("However, they were dissatisfied that you 'violently engaged the local population', at my order.")
L2_BMSG4		_("Personally, I believe that there was no other realistic option.")
L2_BMSG5		_("The stakes are simply too high when discussing weapons such as these...")
L2_BMSG6		_("Nonetheless, now that we have a suitable base of operations, we have a new objective for you.")
L2_BMSG7		_("Your next target is a Pre-Collapse research laboratory located somewhere in this sector.")
L2_BMSG8		_("The Council believes this facility was once the centerpiece for a highly-secretive weapons program.")
L2_BMSG9		_("So secretive, in fact, that we still haven't found it.")
L2_BMSG10		_("To that end, we had identified some individuals who have the information we need.")
L2_BMSG11		_("But when we attempted to reach out to them, they were captured by scavengers.")
L2_BMSG12		_("They are currently being held as hostages nearby.")
L2_BMSG13		_("Commander, take a transport and free those contacts using whatever means necessary.")
L2_BMSG14		_("Reinforcements will be available for this mission.")

/* L3 Surprise Attack */
/* Mission Briefing */
L3_BMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Congratulations once again Commander, you've saved our civilian contacts.")
L3_BMSG2		_("With their help, the Council has been able to pinpoint the location of the facility we're looking for.")
L3_BMSG3		_("However, these contacts also had some ill news...")
L3_BMSG4		_("According to them, the scavengers you've been fighting are searching for this same facility.")
L3_BMSG5		_("It is unknown if they have discovered its location yet.")
L3_BMSG6		_("If this facility was indeed part of some weapons program, it's imperative that we reach it first.")
L3_BMSG7		_("...Furthermore, the Council has once again sought to condemn our methods of victory.")
L3_BMSG8		_("Fearing that 'our continuing aggression may prompt retaliation' from the local gangs.")
L3_BMSG9		_("But let me be clear, this operation is under my directive.")
L3_BMSG10		_("As long as we continue to succeed in our goals, I see no reason for us to not use the most effective methods at our disposal.")
L3_BMSG11		_("Prepare your forces for transport, we're going after that research facility.")
/* Surprise Attack Message */

L3_ATTMSG2		_("We cannot afford to lose this site, repulse this attack immediately!")
/* 'Now Go Kill Everything' Message */
L3_KILLMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Helicopters? Perhaps these scavengers are more resourceful than I gave them credit for...")
L3_KILLMSG2		_("But we've come too far to be outplayed now...")
L3_KILLMSG3		_("Commander, I'm overriding your previous objective; that research facility can wait.")
L3_KILLMSG4		_("Make your way south, and eradicate the scavenger bases there.")
L3_KILLMSG5		_("Neutralize anything that stands in your way.")

/* L4S Biological Research (Setup)*/
/* Mission Briefing */
L4_BMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Extraordinary work Commander, I knew I could count on you.")
L4_BMSG2		_("I have not submitted a report to the Council about this... reprisal by the scavengers.")
L4_BMSG3		_("The way I see it, if they're so adamant against how I conduct my operations...")
L4_BMSG4		_("...Then they don't need to know the details of said operations.")
L4_BMSG5		_("I will submit a report after you've secured the research facility.")
L4_BMSG6		_("Take a transport and send a group there now.")
L4_BMSG7		_("Hopefully, we'll secure the facility before any scavengers can find it.")
L4_BMSG8		_("Admittedly, they've proven themselves to be more cunning than they appeared at first glance.")
L4_BMSG9		_("If this facility truly does contain weapons, it's possible that they might use them against us.")
L4_BMSG10		_("Commander, make sure that doesn't happen.")

/* L5S Town Purge (Setup)*/
/* Mission Briefing */
L5_BMSG1	_("<CLAYDE>: These have been a troubling turn of events, Commander.")
L5_BMSG2	_("That facility was no conventional weapons lab.")
L5_BMSG3	_("It was a bio-weapons lab, designing a virus or pathogen of some sort.")
L5_BMSG4	_("And now those damned scavengers have set it free.")
L5_BMSG5	_("Monitoring of their transmissions show that this infestation has already started spreading between their camps.")
L5_BMSG6	_("If the Council were to learn of our failure to reach the facility in time...")
L5_BMSG7	_("...Of your failure to contain this outbreak...")
L5_BMSG8	_("Commander, from now on we will be continuing independently of the Council's 'oversight'.")
L5_BMSG9	_("I will be the one giving every order going forward.")
L5_BMSG10	_("I don't want you, or any of your men to have any contact with the Council.")
L5_BMSG11	_("For the success of this operation, they cannot know what is happening here.")
L5_BMSG12	_("Your primary objective now is to curtail the spread of this infestation, by any means necessary.")
L5_BMSG13	_("According to scavenger radio chatter, there's a nearby industrial town currently under attack by the infested.")
L5_BMSG14	_("Take your forces there and purge the town.")
L5_BMSG15	_("We must move swiftly and act decisively in order to succeed.")

/* L6S AA Hunter (Setup)*/
/* Mission Briefing */
L6_BMSG1	_("<ASSOCIATE>: Greetings, Commander Alpha.")
L6_BMSG2	_("I am a representative of the Council.")
L6_BMSG3	_("General Clayde has informed us about the current situation.")
L6_BMSG4	_("...And about the events that have transpired since your last report.")
L6_BMSG5	_("I will be acting as your overseer going forward with this operation.")
L6_BMSG6	_("...As per direction of the Council, as well as the General's request.")
L6_BMSG7	_("The General has devised a plan to salvage the situation and contain the infestation.")
L6_BMSG8	_("We will use your base as a rally point for local civilians.")
L6_BMSG9	_("From there, we'll move the survivors to a nearby secure location via transport.")
L6_BMSG10	_("However, we'll need you to clear an obstruction before we can proceed.")
L6_BMSG11	_("To evacuate as many survivors as possible, our transports will need to travel along the shortest route available.")
L6_BMSG12	_("Unfortunately, this puts our transports directly over a scavenger-held stronghold.")
L6_BMSG13	_("Additionally, we have detected multiple Pre-Collapse anti-air batteries in this area.")
L6_BMSG14	_("It's likely that the scavengers here will use these AA sites to attack our transports.")
L6_BMSG15	_("Due to your... previous 'interactions' with them.")
L6_BMSG16	_("Commander Alpha, take your forces to these sites.")
L6_BMSG17	_("Disable any AA emplacements so that our transports can pass through safely.")

/* L6 AA Hunter */
/* Infested Wave Imminent Message */

/* L7 Final Defensive */
/* Mission Briefing */
L7_BMSG1		_("<ASSOCIATE>: Welcome back, Commander Alpha.")
L7_BMSG2		_("We are pleased with your success in disabling those AA guns.")
L7_BMSG3		_("However, even without them impeding our progress, our evacuation is still behind schedule.")
L7_BMSG4		_("We're still picking up groups of stragglers from around your sector.")
L7_BMSG5		_("But the infested are on the move, and are closing in on us even now.")
L7_BMSG6		_("We don't have much time left; you must defend the base while we finish the evacuation.")
L7_BMSG7		_("Once all civilians and critical personnel are away, we'll have the transports come back for you and your forces.")
L7_BMSG8		_("Then, we'll remotely detonate the warheads in those silos and put an end to this once and for all.")
L7_BMSG9		_("This is it Commander. Good luck.")
/* Reveal Message */
L7_REVMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Commander Alpha, this is General Clayde.")
L7_REVMSG2		_("The evacuation was a success, the final survivors have reached the safe haven...")
L7_REVMSG3		_("...But those transports are not coming back for you.")
L7_REVMSG4		_("When I gave my report to the Council, I told them that you had gone rogue.")
L7_REVMSG5		_("I told them the only reason for the scavengers' hostility...")
L7_REVMSG6		_("...The reason that this infection was released...")
L7_REVMSG7		_("...Was your own recklessness and negligence of duty.")
L7_REVMSG8		_("I told them that you had betrayed the Syndicate to pursue your own personal ambitions.")
L7_REVMSG9		_("And you know what happened?")
L7_REVMSG10		_("They believed it. All of it.")
L7_REVMSG11		_("Honestly, I don't blame them.")
L7_REVMSG12		_("When things go awry, isn't it easier to blame a no-name Commander...")
L7_REVMSG13		_("...Than your most experienced general?")
L7_REVMSG14		_("They see you now as a liability. Nothing more than a threat to our goals.")
L7_REVMSG15		_("No less of a threat than this infestation itself.")
L7_REVMSG16		_("But personally...")
L7_REVMSG17		_("I do not cherish this moment, Commander.")
L7_REVMSG18		_("You've proven yourself to be exceptionally capable.")
L7_REVMSG19		_("I had hoped that you would help us achieve great things.")
L7_REVMSG20		_("But someone has to take the fall for this mess.")
L7_REVMSG21		_("And my role is far too important to squander; especially with what comes next.")
L7_REVMSG22		_("However, you still have one crucial role to fulfill...")
L7_REVMSG23		_("Bait.")
L7_REVMSG24		_("The infested are approaching your base from every direction.")
L7_REVMSG25		_("Every single unit in the sector is converging on your position.")
L7_REVMSG26		_("And the nuclear warheads stored in those silos have been primed to detonate.")
L7_REVMSG27		_("In a single blast, both you and the infested will all be reduced to ashes.")
L7_REVMSG28		_("In the end, I will be remembered as the one who triumphed over hostile scavenger clans, a rampaging infection...")
L7_REVMSG29		_("...And a treacherous Commander.")
L7_REVMSG30		_("As for you?")

/* Prologue */
/* P1 */
/* Mission Briefing */
P1_BMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Greetings, Commander. I am General Edmund Clayde.")
P1_BMSG2		_("You have been assigned to lead team Bravo.")
P1_BMSG3		_("You, along with Commander Charlie, are to assist with my operations in this sector.")
P1_BMSG4		_("I assume you have already been briefed on the current situation before arriving...")
P1_BMSG5		_("For a lack of a better term, an 'infestation' has run rampant among the population.")
P1_BMSG6		_("Even worse, the group sent here before you, Team Alpha, has gone rogue.")
P1_BMSG7		_("Therefore, we'll need to work quickly in order to salvage this situation.")
P1_BMSG8		_("Commander Charlie has already begun setting up a safe haven nearby.")
P1_BMSG9		_("Commander Bravo, your objective is to investigate this town.")
P1_BMSG10		_("After the initial outbreak, a large amount of the infested converged on this area, and have remained here since.")
P1_BMSG11		_("We want to find out why they've lingered here specifically.")
P1_BMSG12		_("Take a squad and make your way towards this area.")
P1_BMSG13		_("Expect a heavy hostile presence, especially as you approach the main town.")
P1_BMSG14		_("Good luck, Commander Bravo.")

/* P2 */
/* Mission Briefing */
P2_BMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Commander Bravo, excellent work on securing the town.")
P2_BMSG2		_("I would like to introduce you to my Lieutenant.")
P2_BMSG3		_("He has been reviewing what you recovered from the previous mission.")
P2_BMSG4		_("<LIEUTENANT>: Greetings, Commander Bravo.")
P2_BMSG5		_("The device that you found appears to be a sort of 'lure' for the infested.")
P2_BMSG6		_("When activated, it emits a signal that draws the infested towards it.")
P2_BMSG7		_("It's likely that the scavengers who had set up fortifications in the town had activated the Lure by accident.")
P2_BMSG8		_("And, well...")
P2_BMSG9		_("<CLAYDE>: Yes, I think we can all guess what happened to them.")
P2_BMSG10		_("Lieutenant, do we know why this device was here in the first place?")
P2_BMSG11		_("<LIEUTENANT>: Yes, sir. It would appear that our suspicions were correct.")
P2_BMSG12		_("We recovered a plethora of documents from the town that confirm that these Lures pre-date the Collapse.")
P2_BMSG13		_("Both the items we've found and the Infested themselves were all part of a Pre-Collapse weapons program, known only as 'Project X'.")
P2_BMSG14		_("Apparently, they were to be discreetly shipped from this town to other military sites.")
P2_BMSG15		_("But after the Collapse, they were left collecting dust here.")
P2_BMSG16		_("<CLAYDE>: What else have we found in that town?")
P2_BMSG17		_("<LIEUTENANT>: Besides the Lures themselves, there also appears to be schematics for fabricating them.")
P2_BMSG18		_("And, there's these large capsule-like containers...")
P2_BMSG19		_("But we have yet to identify what is inside.")
P2_BMSG20		_("<CLAYDE>: Understood. Continue your work, Lieutenant.")
P2_BMSG21		_("<LIEUTENANT>: Yes, sir.")
P2_BMSG22		_("<CLAYDE>: Commander Bravo, continue making your way to Team Charlie's haven.")
P2_BMSG23		_("Once you arrive, assist them in any way you can with their objective.")
P2_BMSG24		_("Meanwhile, I believe we now have the solution to our infestation problem...")
/* Civilian Rescue */
P2_CIVMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Commander Charlie, how are the evacuation efforts?")
P2_CIVMSG2		_("<CHARLIE>: We're set up in the place you specified, General.")
P2_CIVMSG3		_("Transports from around the sector have been arriving regularly, but...")
P2_CIVMSG4		_("We've detected some groups that have tried to make it here on foot.")
P2_CIVMSG5		_("They're pinned down in the hills north of us, sir.")
P2_CIVMSG6		_("<CLAYDE>: Hmm... This complicates things.")
P2_CIVMSG7		_("We shouldn't leave anyone behind, if it can be avoided.")
P2_CIVMSG8		_("<CHARLIE>: General, sir, if I may give a suggestion?")
P2_CIVMSG9		_("Escorting the civilians on foot would be risky.")
P2_CIVMSG10		_("We could load the civilians into the backs of our Trucks instead.")
P2_CIVMSG11		_("That way, we could just drive the civilians back to the haven ourselves.")
P2_CIVMSG12		_("<CLAYDE>: That's... a sound idea, Commander Charlie.")
P2_CIVMSG13		_("Commander Bravo, take command of the haven.")
P2_CIVMSG14		_("Bring a Truck to each of the civilian holdouts.")
P2_CIVMSG15		_("Once the civilians are onboard, drive them back to the haven.")
P2_CIVMSG16		_("Await further orders once all the civilians are accounted for.")

/* Act 1 */
/* A1L1 */
/* Mission Briefing */
A1L1_BMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Alright, everyone sit down and listen up.")
A1L1_BMSG2		_("The Council has just approved our next operation.")
A1L1_BMSG3		_("Which means, no matter what you may have heard or thought about me...")
A1L1_BMSG4		_("...Especially after the recent... incident, regarding Team Alpha.")
A1L1_BMSG5		_("You are all under my command for now.")
A1L1_BMSG6		_("Understood?")
A1L1_BMSG7		_("Now, to business.")
A1L1_BMSG8		_("Our main target is the mother of all military sites.")
A1L1_BMSG9		_("NASDA Central.")
A1L1_BMSG10		_("We were able to pull its location from the site uncovered by Team Alpha.")
A1L1_BMSG11		_("It's located in the Eastern Sector, deep within what was once a sprawling urban metropolis.")
A1L1_BMSG12		_("The Council is fully interested in claiming it, so we're putting all of NARS into this.")
A1L1_BMSG13		_("So, here's the plan:")
A1L1_BMSG14		_("Each of you has been assigned a designated landing zone.")
A1L1_BMSG15		_("After arriving, secure the area and establish a base of operations.")
A1L1_BMSG16		_("Once all teams are set up, we'll move out and claim NASDA Central for NARS.")
A1L1_BMSG17		_("The city was probably hit hard during the Collapse, so I wouldn't expect many obstacles.")
A1L1_BMSG18		_("Still, after the last operation, we're not taking any chances with this.")
A1L1_BMSG19		_("Additionally, after the Alpha Incident, we're assigning Commanders into groups of two.")
A1L1_BMSG20		_("Commander Bravo, you'll be partnered with Commander Charlie again.")
A1L1_BMSG21		_("Commanders Delta and Echo will be paired together, as well as Foxtrot and Golf.")
A1L1_BMSG22		_("Keep an eye on each other, have each other's backs, and this should be a walk in the park.")

A1L2_BMSG4		_("What are we up against?")
A1L2_BMSG5		_("<LIEUTENANT>: Yes sir. We've done some aerial reconnaissance using our transporters.")
A1L2_BMSG6		_("Our observations are limited, but we've detected a large scavenger presence around NASDA Central.")
A1L2_BMSG7		_("It seems one of the local factions has been using it as their base of operations.")
A1L2_BMSG8		_("<CLAYDE>: I see...")
A1L2_BMSG9		_("Still, I'm sure it's nothing that we can't handle.")
A1L2_BMSG10		_("Commander Bravo, seeing as you have the most combat experience, you will serve as a pathfinder.")
A1L2_BMSG11		_("Transport your forces to the outskirts of NASDA Central.")
A1L2_BMSG12		_("From there, clear the landing zones for teams Charlie, Foxtrot, and Golf.")
A1L2_BMSG13		_("Then together, secure the area of hostiles and capture NASDA Central.")

A1L3_BMSG3		_("How long until the systems are operational?")
A1L3_BMSG4		_("<LIETENANT>: It's hard to give a full analysis at this point.")
A1L3_BMSG5		_("NASDA's computer systems are vast and we've only been able to examine a portion of it.")
A1L3_BMSG6		_("So far, we've found signs of electromagnetic damage, likely as a result of the Collapse.")
A1L3_BMSG7		_("Entire memory banks appear to have been fried, and the core processor is shattered.")
A1L3_BMSG8		_("<CLAYDE>: What of the satellite control systems?")
A1L3_BMSG9		_("<LIETENANT>: Some subsystems might have been spared from damage...")
A1L3_BMSG10		_("But the main uplink itself is currently non-functional.")
A1L3_BMSG11		_("However, we've found what appear to be coordinates to nearby satellite uplink stations.")
A1L3_BMSG12		_("It's possible that they could be used as a relay to connect NASDA's control systems and the satellites.")
A1L3_BMSG13		_("...If any of these uplinks are still operational, that is.")
A1L3_BMSG14		_("<CLAYDE>: I see. Then our next objective is clear.")
A1L3_BMSG15		_("While I help the Council settle into NASDA Central, the Commanders will search for these uplink sites.")
A1L3_BMSG16		_("Commander Bravo. One of these uplinks appears to lie east of your current position.")
A1L3_BMSG17		_("Take your forces there and secure the area.")
A1L3_BMSG18		_("I'll have the other Commanders move out and search in the meantime.")

/* A1L4 */

A1L4_BMSG5		_("We don't know their numbers, capabilities, or motives.")
A1L4_BMSG6		_("But from Bravo's brief skirmish, they appear to be well-equipped.")
A1L4_BMSG7		_("<CLAYDE>: Alright, then we should be on high alert.")
A1L4_BMSG8		_("And what of the uplink secured by team Bravo?")
A1L4_BMSG9		_("<LIEUTENANT>: It appears to be at least partially functional, sir.")
A1L4_BMSG10		_("We should be able to establish a connection between NASDA central and the orbiting satellites within a matter of days.")
