L1_BMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Greetings Commander.")
L1_BMSG2		_("I am Edmund Clayde, current head General of the North American Reclamation Syndicate.")
L1_BMSG3		_("I'll act as the overseer of this operation.")
L1_BMSG4		_("You have been assigned to lead team Alpha to accomplish our goals.")
L1_BMSG5		_("Your first task is to establish a base of operations.")
L1_BMSG6		_("Recovered documents evidence the existence of a Pre-Collapse NASDA site located south of your position.")
L1_BMSG7		_("We believe this site likely houses nuclear weapons.")
L1_BMSG8		_("Therefore, securing it is our first priority.")
L1_BMSG9		_("Take your forces, and travel overland towards this site.")
L1_BMSG10		_("You may need to use your weapons to clear a path through the trees.")
/* Wall Message */
L1_WALLMSG1		_("You're close now Commander, this appears to be the base's eastern wall.")
L1_WALLMSG2		_("Use your weapons to bring it down, and then get inside.")
/* Base Message */
L1_BASEMSG1		_("Well done Commander. I'm sure the Council will be pleased to know of our success.")
L1_BASEMSG2		_("I've sent a transport with trucks to your position. Use them to get this base up and running.")
L1_BASEMSG3		_("Make sure to construct a generator and investigate that research facility for anything useful.")
/* Scavenger Message */
L1_SCAVMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: I've had my technicians run a quick analysis on the site you have found.")
L1_SCAVMSG2		_("After a preliminary scan, we can confirm that these silos indeed contain nuclear warheads.")
L1_SCAVMSG3		_("However, your mission is not over yet, Commander.")
L1_SCAVMSG4		_("We've detected numerous radio transmissions from scavengers around the NASDA site.")
L1_SCAVMSG5		_("If their radio chatter is anything to go by, then they're too busy fighting each other to notice us yet.")
L1_SCAVMSG6		_("Commander Alpha, I'm ordering you to clear them out in order to ensure the safety of this site.")
L1_SCAVMSG7		_("Take some time to establish your forces, then move out and neutralize any nearby outposts.")
L1_SCAVMSG8		_("Regardless of how you feel about diplomacy, this site is too important to negotiate over with the local gangs.")
/* Town Message */
L1_TOWNMSG1		_("See how this small river town's been torn apart by these warring gangs?")
L1_TOWNMSG2		_("If we succeed in our goal, we can bring an end to all this chaos.")
L1_TOWNMSG3		_("We will build a new world, a better world.")
L1_TOWNMSG4		_("But these scavengers only serve to stand in our way...")
/* Player Detection Message */
L1_DETMSG1		_("Commander, monitoring of scavenger radio chatter shows that they're aware of your presence, and are preparing to retaliate.")
L1_DETMSG2		_("Be ready to defend our base.")
L1_DETMSG3		_("Do not allow them to compromise the mission!")

/* L2S Hostages (Setup)*/
/* Mission Briefing */
L2_BMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Congratulations on securing our new base, Commander.")
L2_BMSG2		_("The Council has reviewed the report of your success and are pleased with your results.")
L2_BMSG3		_("However, they were dissatisfied that you 'violently engaged the local population', at my order.")
L2_BMSG4		_("Personally, I believe that there was no other realistic option.")
L2_BMSG5		_("The stakes are simply too high when discussing weapons such as these...")
L2_BMSG6		_("Nonetheless, now that we have a suitable base of operations, we have a new objective for you.")
L2_BMSG7		_("Your next target is a Pre-Collapse research laboratory located somewhere in this sector.")
L2_BMSG8		_("The Council believes this facility was once the centerpiece for a highly-secretive weapons program.")
L2_BMSG9		_("So secretive, in fact, that we still haven't found it.")
L2_BMSG10		_("To that end, we had identified some individuals who have the information we need.")
L2_BMSG11		_("But when we attempted to reach out to them, they were captured by scavengers.")
L2_BMSG12		_("They are currently being held as hostages nearby.")
L2_BMSG13		_("Commander, take a transport and free those contacts using whatever means necessary.")
L2_BMSG14		_("Reinforcements will be available for this mission.")

/* L2 Hostages */
/* Scavenger Message 1 */
L2_SCAVMSG1		_("These scavengers are proving to be more than a nuisance.")
L2_SCAVMSG2		_("But the more they stand in the way of our goals, the more destruction we shall cause them.")
L2_SCAVMSG3		_("Go on, Commander.")
/* Scavenger Message 2 */
L2_SCAV2MSG1	_("When you've finished your work out there I'll have some extra questions for our contacts.")
L2_SCAV2MSG2	_("These scavengers seem to have a particular interest in them, which may mean they're after the same goal.")
L2_SCAV2MSG3	_("You've proven yourself quite capable, Commander. I am confident that you are more than able to handle whatever these hooligans can throw at us.")

/* L3 Surprise Attack */
/* Mission Briefing */
L3_BMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Congratulations once again Commander, you've saved our civilian contacts.")
L3_BMSG2		_("With their help, the Council has been able to pinpoint the location of the facility we're looking for.")
L3_BMSG3		_("However, these contacts also had some ill news...")
L3_BMSG4		_("According to them, the scavengers you've been fighting are searching for this same facility.")
L3_BMSG5		_("It is unknown if they have discovered its location yet.")
L3_BMSG6		_("If this facility was indeed part of some weapons program, it's imperative that we reach it first.")
L3_BMSG7		_("...Furthermore, the Council has once again sought to condemn our methods of victory.")
L3_BMSG8		_("Fearing that 'our continuing aggression may prompt retaliation' from the local gangs.")
L3_BMSG9		_("But let me be clear, this operation is under my directive.")
L3_BMSG10		_("As long as we continue to succeed in our goals, I see no reason for us to not use the most effective methods at our disposal.")
L3_BMSG11		_("Prepare your forces for transport, we're going after that research facility.")

/* 'Now Go Kill Everything' Message */
L3_KILLMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Helicopters? Perhaps these scavengers are more resourceful than I gave them credit for...")
L3_KILLMSG2		_("But we've come too far to be outplayed now...")
L3_KILLMSG3		_("Commander, I'm overriding your previous objective; that research facility can wait.")
L3_KILLMSG4		_("Make your way south, and eradicate the scavenger bases there.")
L3_KILLMSG5		_("Neutralize anything that stands in your way.")

/* L4S Biological Research (Setup)*/
/* Mission Briefing */
L4_BMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Extraordinary work Commander, I knew I could count on you.")
L4_BMSG2		_("I have not submitted a report to the Council about this... reprisal by the scavengers.")
L4_BMSG3		_("The way I see it, if they're so adamant against how I conduct my operations...")
L4_BMSG4		_("...Then they don't need to know the details of said operations.")
L4_BMSG5		_("I will submit a report after you've secured the research facility.")
L4_BMSG6		_("Take a transport and send a group there now.")
L4_BMSG7		_("Hopefully, we'll secure the facility before any scavengers can find it.")
L4_BMSG8		_("Admittedly, they've proven themselves to be more cunning than they appeared at first glance.")
L4_BMSG9		_("If this facility truly does contain weapons, it's possible that they might use them against us.")
L4_BMSG10		_("Commander, make sure that doesn't happen.")

/* L4 Biological Research */
/* Ominous Message */
L4_WARNMSG1		_("Damnation! Those scavengers are already here.")
L4_WARNMSG2		_("Clear them out and advance towards the research facility.")

/* `Go Break Stuff` Message */
L4_KILLMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Commander, I'm having a hard time believing what I'm seeing right now...")
L4_KILLMSG2		_("So I'm giving you a new, clear objective.")
L4_KILLMSG3		_("Commander Alpha, destroy that research facility.")
L4_KILLMSG4		_("Eradicate anyone or anything that stands in your way.")
L4_KILLMSG5		_("Lock down this entire area. Don't let anything here survive...")
L4_KILLMSG6		_("...Scavenger or otherwise.")

/* L5S Town Purge (Setup)*/
/* Mission Briefing */
L5_BMSG1	_("<CLAYDE>: These have been a troubling turn of events, Commander.")
L5_BMSG2	_("That facility was no conventional weapons lab.")
L5_BMSG3	_("It was a bio-weapons lab, designing a virus or pathogen of some sort.")
L5_BMSG4	_("And now those damned scavengers have set it free.")
L5_BMSG5	_("Monitoring of their transmissions show that this infestation has already started spreading between their camps.")
L5_BMSG6	_("If the Council were to learn of our failure to reach the facility in time...")
L5_BMSG7	_("...Of your failure to contain this outbreak...")
L5_BMSG8	_("Commander, from now on we will be continuing independently of the Council's 'oversight'.")
L5_BMSG9	_("I will be the one giving every order going forward.")
L5_BMSG10	_("I don't want you, or any of your men to have any contact with the Council.")
L5_BMSG11	_("For the success of this operation, they cannot know what is happening here.")
L5_BMSG12	_("Your primary objective now is to curtail the spread of this infestation, by any means necessary.")
L5_BMSG13	_("According to scavenger radio chatter, there's a nearby industrial town currently under attack by the infested.")
L5_BMSG14	_("Take your forces there and purge the town.")
L5_BMSG15	_("We must move swiftly and act decisively in order to succeed.")

/* L5 Town Purge */
/* Scav Base Message */
L5_SCAVMSG1		_("Commander, continue forward and eradicate that scavenger base.")
L5_SCAVMSG2		_("Infested or not, they still pose a threat to our cause, and as such must be rooted out.")
L5_SCAVMSG3		_("If we are to succeed, we cannot allow any loose ends to remain.")

/* L6S AA Hunter (Setup)*/
/* Mission Briefing */
L6_BMSG1	_("<ASSOCIATE>: Greetings, Commander Alpha.")
L6_BMSG2	_("I am a representative of the Council.")
L6_BMSG3	_("General Clayde has informed us about the current situation.")
L6_BMSG4	_("...And about the events that have transpired since your last report.")
L6_BMSG5	_("I will be acting as your overseer going forward with this operation.")
L6_BMSG6	_("...As per direction of the Council, as well as the General's request.")
L6_BMSG7	_("The General has devised a plan to salvage the situation and contain the infestation.")
L6_BMSG8	_("We will use your base as a rally point for local civilians.")
L6_BMSG9	_("From there, we'll move the survivors to a nearby secure location via transport.")
L6_BMSG10	_("However, we'll need you to clear an obstruction before we can proceed.")
L6_BMSG11	_("To evacuate as many survivors as possible, our transports will need to travel along the shortest route available.")
L6_BMSG12	_("Unfortunately, this puts our transports directly over a scavenger-held stronghold.")
L6_BMSG13	_("Additionally, we have detected multiple Pre-Collapse anti-air batteries in this area.")
L6_BMSG14	_("It's likely that the scavengers here will use these AA sites to attack our transports.")
L6_BMSG15	_("Due to your... previous 'interactions' with them.")
L6_BMSG16	_("Commander Alpha, take your forces to these sites.")
L6_BMSG17	_("Disable any AA emplacements so that our transports can pass through safely.")
L6_BMSG18	_("Countless lives are now depending on your success.")

/* L6 AA Hunter */
/* Infested Wave Warning Message */
L6_INFESMSG1	_("Commander be advised: we have received reports that large numbers of infested are amassing just outside your area of operation.")
L6_INFESMSG2	_("Judging by the large scavenger presence here, the infested are most likely preparing to overrun whatever is left of them.")
L6_INFESMSG3	_("Please work quickly; we are unsure of when they will begin to descend upon this position.")
/* AA Site Reminder Message */
L6_AAMSG1		_("Commander, a reminder to not allow yourself to be distracted from your goal.")
L6_AAMSG2		_("Your primary objective is to neutralize the designated anti-aircraft batteries, and then return to base.")
L6_AAMSG3		_("We cannot afford to have you waste time out there, Commander.")
/* Infested Wave Imminent Message */
L6_WAVEMSG1		_("<ASSOCIATE>: Commander Alpha, the infested are converging towards your location en masse.")
L6_WAVEMSG2		_("Their numbers are far too great to estimate; retreat immediately to the LZ for extraction.")
L6_WAVEMSG3		_("There's no feasible way for your forces to maintain their position much longer.")
/* 'You Are Taking Too Long' Message */
L6_SCOLDMSG1	_("What are you still doing out there?!")
L6_SCOLDMSG2	_("Are you searching for more glory? More trial by combat?")
L6_SCOLDMSG3	_("By delaying your orders to retreat, you are only putting yourself and your own troops at risk.")
L6_SCOLDMSG4	_("Regroup at the LZ for evac, unless you'd rather we call off the transports and leave you behind.")

/* L7 Final Defensive */
/* Mission Briefing */
L7_BMSG1		_("<ASSOCIATE>: Welcome back, Commander Alpha.")
L7_BMSG2		_("We are pleased with your success in disabling those AA guns.")
L7_BMSG3		_("However, even without them impeding our progress, our evacuation is still behind schedule.")
L7_BMSG4		_("We're still picking up groups of stragglers from around your sector.")
L7_BMSG5		_("But the infested are on the move, and are closing in on us even now.")
L7_BMSG6		_("We don't have much time left; you must defend the base while we finish the evacuation.")
L7_BMSG7		_("Once all civilians and critical personnel are away, we'll have the transports come back for you and your forces.")
L7_BMSG8		_("Then, we'll remotely detonate the warheads in those silos and put an end to this once and for all.")
L7_BMSG9		_("This is it Commander. Good luck.")
/* Transport Message */
L7_TMSG1		_("Excellent work. All civilians and critical personnel are being transported to a safe distance.")
L7_TMSG2		_("We'll be sending the transports back around for you soon, Commander.")
L7_TMSG3		_("Just hold out for another few minutes.")
L7_TMSG4		_("This will all be over soon...")
/* Reveal Message */
L7_REVMSG1		_("<CLAYDE>: Commander Alpha, this is General Clayde.")
L7_REVMSG2		_("The evacuation was a success, the final survivors have reached the safe haven...")
L7_REVMSG3		_("...But those transports are not coming back for you.")
L7_REVMSG4		_("When I gave my report to the Council, I told them that you had gone rogue.")
L7_REVMSG5		_("I told them the only reason for the scavengers' hostility...")
L7_REVMSG6		_("...The reason that this infection was released...")
L7_REVMSG7		_("...Was your own recklessness and negligence of duty.")
L7_REVMSG8		_("I told them that you had betrayed the Syndicate to pursue your own personal ambitions.")
L7_REVMSG9		_("And you know what happened?")
L7_REVMSG10		_("They believed it. All of it.")
L7_REVMSG11		_("Honestly, I don't blame them.")
L7_REVMSG12		_("When things go awry, isn't it easier to blame a no-name Commander...")
L7_REVMSG13		_("...Than your most experienced general?")
L7_REVMSG14		_("They see you now as a liability. Nothing more than a threat to our goals.")
L7_REVMSG15		_("No less of a threat than this infestation itself.")
L7_REVMSG16		_("But personally...")
L7_REVMSG17		_("I do not cherish this moment, Commander.")
L7_REVMSG18		_("You've proven yourself to be exceptionally capable.")
L7_REVMSG19		_("I had hoped that you would help us achieve great things.")
L7_REVMSG20		_("But someone has to take the fall for this mess.")
L7_REVMSG21		_("And my role is far too important to squander; especially with what comes next.")
L7_REVMSG22		_("However, you still have one crucial role to fulfill...")
L7_REVMSG23		_("Bait.")
L7_REVMSG24		_("The infested are approaching your base from every direction.")
L7_REVMSG25		_("Every single unit in the sector is converging on your position.")
L7_REVMSG26		_("And the nuclear warheads stored in those silos have been primed to detonate.")
L7_REVMSG27		_("In a single blast, both you and the infested will all be reduced to ashes.")
L7_REVMSG28		_("In the end, I will be remembered as the one who triumphed over hostile scavenger clans, a rampaging infection...")
L7_REVMSG29		_("...And a treacherous Commander.")
L7_REVMSG30		_("As for you?")
L7_REVMSG31		_("You will be remembered as another obstacle overcame by the great General Edmund Clayde.")
